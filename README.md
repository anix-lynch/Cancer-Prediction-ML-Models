## 🧬 Predicting Cancer Risk with Machine Learning Models

In this project, we’ll work on **predicting cancer risk** using **multiclass classification** based on genetic mutations. The goal is to assign each genetic mutation into one of nine categories (malignant or benign) using a combination of **medical text data** and **machine learning models**. Ready to dive into data analysis and model evaluation? Let’s get started! 🚀🧑‍🔬

## Project Overview

In this project, we’ll classify genetic mutations into nine distinct categories. By analyzing the **gene** and **variation** fields, along with additional medical text data, we’ll use **multiclass classification** to determine whether a mutation is **malignant** (driver) or **benign** (passenger). This has real-world implications for predicting cancer risk in patients and guiding treatment decisions.

We’ll cover the entire machine learning pipeline, from **data preprocessing** and **feature encoding** to **model evaluation** and **hyperparameter tuning**. Along the way, we’ll handle challenges like class imbalances, interpret evaluation metrics like **log-loss**, and explore the criteria for accepting ML models in medical applications.

### Key Features:

- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess medical textual data for machine learning models.
- 📊 **Feature Encoding**: Compare one-hot encoding with response encoding for various models.
- 🎛️ **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of models using metrics like **log-loss** and check the importance of individual features.
- 🧬 **Multiclass Classification**: Predict the risk of cancer by classifying genetic mutations into nine categories.
- ⚖️ **Data Analysis**: Perform analysis to check for class imbalances and interpret ambiguous evaluation metrics.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for building and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **pandas**: For handling and preprocessing the dataset.
